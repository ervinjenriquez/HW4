1.	Write a program that calls a recursive method called repeat that accepts a string s and an integer n as parameters and that returns s concatenated together n times.  
For example: repeat(“cs”, 3) returns “cscscs”, repeat (“cs”, 0) returns “”. 
 
2.	Write a recursive method isReverse that accepts two strings as a parameter and returns true if the two strings contain the same sequence of characters as each other but in the reverse order. For example, the string "hello" backwards is "olleh", so a call of isReverse("Java", "avaJ") would return true and isReverse( “Java, ava) would return false. 
 
3.	Write a recursive method called starString that accepts an integer as a parameter and prints to the console a string of starts (asterisks) that is 2n (i.e. 2 to the nth power) long. For example: 
starString(0) should print * (because 20 == 1) starString(2) should print **** (because 22 == 4) 
starStrting(4) should print **************** (because 24 == 16)
